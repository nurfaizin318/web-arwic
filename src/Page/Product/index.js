                                        As we have seen in this HR series for small businesses, there are some human resource requirements that are very important for small businesses. You need to hire the right people, offer competitive salaries and benefits, provide effective training, and more. But in most small businesses, resources are very limited. With little reserve to attract and many competing priorities, it is difficult to justify the costs of hiring a dedicated HR team. Thus, the HR function can be part-time responsibilities for other owners or managers, so they donâ€™t always get the attention they deserve. In this scenario, outsourcing some or all of your HR functions to an external provider can give you a lot of sense
